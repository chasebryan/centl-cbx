# Ten-cofactor odd-support separation through k55

**Status:** exact algebraic module inside the candidate decomposition framework  
**Date:** 2026-08-16  
**Depends on:** landed five-cofactor support-separation theorem  
**Verifier:** `verify_ten_cofactor_odd_support_separation.py`  
**Claim boundary:** exact support-separation theorem on the two realized h169 k19 routes. This is not a termination theorem, not a closed decomposition method, and not an Erdős–Straus proof.

## 1. Complete local companion coordinates

On either realized h169 k19 route write

`C19 = SR = 47 + 210t`,

where

- Route A: `S=391=17*23`;
- Route B: `S=1081=23*47`.

The post-k19 companion ladder through k55 is consecutive:

```text
C19 = SR
C23 = SR+1 =  6B
C27 = SR+2 =  7E
C31 = SR+3 = 10D
C35 = SR+4 =  3F
C39 = SR+5 =  2G
C43 = SR+6 =    H
C47 = SR+7 =  6J
C51 = SR+8 =  5K
C55 = SR+9 = 14L
```

Equivalently,

```text
B =  8 + 35t
E =  7 + 30t
D =  5 + 21t
F = 17 + 70t
G = 26 +105t
H = 53 +210t
J =  9 + 35t
K = 11 + 42t
L =  4 + 15t
```

The landed theorem proves `R,B,E,D,F` pairwise coprime. The present theorem extends the support analysis across all ten cofactor reservoirs.

## 2. Main theorem

For either realized route, the **odd parts** of

`R,B,E,D,F,G,H,J,K,L`

are pairwise coprime.

Equivalently:

> no odd rational prime divides two distinct cofactor reservoirs anywhere in the k19..k55 local ladder.

The only possible support recycling is 2-adic, and it is completely explicit:

```text
gcd(B,G) = gcd(2,t)
gcd(G,L) = gcd(2,t)
gcd(D,J) = gcd(2,t+1)
gcd(B,L) = gcd(4,t)
```

Every other pair among the ten cofactors has gcd exactly1.

Thus the complete overlap graph has only four edges, all carrying powers of2:

```text
B --2-- G --2-- L
|              /
+---- <=4 ----+

D --2-- J
```

and there are no odd-support edges at all.

## 3. Why R is disjoint from the full later ladder

For Route A,

`R = 107 + 210u`.

For Route B,

`R = 137 + 210u`.

Hence on both routes R is odd and

`R != 0 mod3,5,7`.

If a prime q divides R and a later cofactor attached to `SR+a`, then q divides both `SR` and `SR+a`, so q divides a.

For `1 <= a <= 9`, every possible odd prime divisor of a lies in `{3,5,7}`. None divides R. Since R is also odd,

`gcd(R,Q)=1`

for every

`Q in {B,E,D,F,G,H,J,K,L}`.

## 4. Odd-prime separation among B..L

Let `Q_a=(SR+a)/m_a` and `Q_b=(SR+b)/m_b` be two distinct later cofactors.

If an odd prime q divides both, then q divides

`m_a Q_a = SR+a`

and

`m_b Q_b = SR+b`.

Therefore

`q | (b-a)`.

Because `1 <= a < b <= 9`, any such odd q must be one of

`3,5,7`.

It remains only to rule out simultaneous divisibility by those small primes.

The cofactor residues are:

```text
       mod3       mod5       mod7
B    2+2t          3          1
E      1            2         2t
D      2            t          5
F    2+t            2          3
G      2            1          5
H      2            3          4
J     2t            4          2
K      2          1+2t         4
L      1            4         4+t
```

Only pairs whose offsets differ by a multiple of3,5,or7 need checking. In every such pair, the two zero conditions are incompatible. Therefore no odd prime can occur in two different later cofactors.

## 5. Exact 2-adic seam

Parity is equally rigid:

```text
B even iff t even
E always odd
D even iff t odd
F always odd
G even iff t even
H always odd
J even iff t odd
K always odd
L even iff t even
```

So only the pairs inside `{B,G,L}` and `{D,J}` can share2.

The exact affine identities give sharp gcd bounds:

```text
G - 3B   = 2
7L - G   = 2
7L - 3B  = 4
3J - 5D  = 2
```

Combining those identities with parity yields

```text
gcd(B,G) = 2 if t even, else 1
gcd(G,L) = 2 if t even, else 1
gcd(D,J) = 2 if t odd,  else 1

gcd(B,L) =
  4  if t = 0 mod4
  2  if t = 2 mod4
  1  if t is odd
```

which is exactly the compact formula stated above.

## 6. Framework consequence

The local state is now a collection of **independent odd-prime reservoirs**:

```text
R | B | E | D | F | G | H | J | K | L
```

with only the explicitly controlled 2-adic seam.

Therefore a simultaneous survivor must satisfy the local support grammars by allocating distinct odd rational primes to distinct companion coordinates.

This strengthens the support-renewal principle: odd support is **globally non-recyclable across the entire ten-coordinate local ladder**.

## 7. Relation to phase-volume contraction

The landed phase-volume theorem and this support theorem measure different things:

- phase contraction restricts the allowed residue class of t;
- support separation restricts how prime factors can be distributed across companion coordinates.

Neither subsumes the other.

Their intersection is the natural candidate framework state:

`phase class × survivor modes × separated support reservoirs × affine coupling`.

## 8. Bryan Entanglement Cross boundary

Any Bryan Entanglement Cross annotation remains outside this proof predicate. Directional metadata does not alter arithmetic truth or grant pruning permission.

## 9. Next theorem target

Use the odd-support separation together with the landed support grammars to test arithmetic realizability of the formal product state.

The first target should be to prove that selected combinations of

`k27 mode × k31 mode × k35 branch × phase class`

cannot be realized because their required prime-residue reservoirs conflict with the affine companion identities despite being support-disjoint.

That would be a genuine product-state elimination theorem rather than another local fixed-shift classification.

Erdős–Straus remains open.
